Baby voyager test 1 is to measure the wheel speed and IMU readings for slip and no slip conditions.

In both conditions, the car will go forward for a few seconds and then start turning tight.

For the no slip, the car drives on a normal surface at an ordinary speed.

For the slip, the car is made to go on more slippery conditions.

The differences will give clues as to how to detect the slip. Maybe?
